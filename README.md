# Gatsby Tutorial Part 1

This repo follows the steps in [part one](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-one/) of the [seven part tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) on the Gatsby website.<br>
In this tutorial, I <br>
* add inline styles via a JavaScript style prop, 
* create links, 
* create React page components, 
* and add an interactive counter. 

The website created in this repo is built from the [gatsby-hello-world](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) starter, which has the bare essentials needed for a Gatsby site.

The website is deployed on [fuzzy-month.surge.sh](http://fuzzy-month.surge.sh).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed. You can install both npm and Node by installing [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) since npm is distributed with Node. You can use a Node.js version manager like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to switch Node versions between projects.

If you want to use Gatsby's command line tool, you need to install it. 

`npm install --global gatsby-cli`

### Install project

In the terminal, move to the directory you want this repo to be in.

`cd parentDirectoryPath`

If you have git installed, clone this repo. You can also download this repo by clicking on the green "Clone or download" button. 

`git clone https://github.com/eunicode/gatsby-tut-1.git`

### Install dependencies

`npm install`

## Running in development

If you have Gatsby's command line tool installed, you can run the command `gatsby develop`, and Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible at localhost:8000.

You can see more CLI commands in the [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).
